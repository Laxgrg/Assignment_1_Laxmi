# Welcome to Laxgrg's Github Profile 
I'm Laxmi Gurung, currently studying Software Development at Trios College. Technology is my passion, and I see it as this amazing puzzle that I'm always excited to solve. I'm deeply interested in web development, with a focus on building user-friendly websites. For me, creating intuitive and accessible interfaces is key to enhancing the user experience. I'm constantly learning and honing my skills to become better at it.
I'm eager to collaborate with others who share my enthusiasm for web development. I believe that working with like-minded individuals not only fosters creativity but also accelerates learning. Together, we can push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm and create innovative solutions that positively impact people's lives.
